# Question formulation

* What do we want to know
Are we generating new hypotheses?

# Data Acquisition / Cleaning

* How will we collect

Related to metrics for success.

Population, frame, sample.

* How do we organize the data for analysis?

# Exploratory Data Analysis

* What's the best way to visualize the data?

# Inference and Prediction

* How robust are our conclusions / what is our uncertainty?

Can we come up with a robust answer despite the uncertainty.


# Pandas

# Pandas Data Structures

* Data Frame: 2D tabular data
* Indices: 1D data **series**; a sequence of labels

* `loc` vs. `iloc` (think if `i` as indicated an integer)

# Goals for today

Discuss aggregation:
*
*
* A case study

# Method chaining

Also sometimes called "_piping_" Making multiple method calls sequentially and returning the resulting object


# Groupby


1. Group by Major
2. Mean of "Random Number"

`x_i` comes from random Normal distribution (mean 0, std 1)

```
E[x_i] = 0, Var(x_i) = 1

Y = 1/N_g * sum(x_i), where i = g

E(Y) =

Var(Y) = 1/(N**2)*N = 1/N

SD = sqrt(var)

STSDS =
```

# Multi-index
groupby
