Announcements

* HW 1 due tomorrow

* HW 2 out tomorrow (due in 2 weeks)


# Probability Distribution

Concrete: n = 4 and Y = X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 and the Xs
are independent with same chance of 0 or 1
(knowing the value of X1 doesn’t change X2
distribution).
P(Y = 2) =

n independent 0-1 variables

Y = X1 + ... + Xn

P(Xi = 1) = p

Probability Mass Function

# Probability Problem Related to
question on HW 2:
* Roll a fair die 5 times.
* NE = number of evens,
* NT = number of threes or fives
* N1 = number of 1s

Count Arrangements

# Empirical (Data) vs. Model (World)

### Empirical (Data)
* DATA: x1, x2, ..., xn (lowercase)

* The sample that we have to work with
* Summary statistic that minimizes the _empirical risk_

### Model (World)
• Random Variables: X1, X2, ..., Xn (uppercase)
• Probability distribution from,
e.g., a SRS from the population
* Probability parameter that minimizes _the Risk_

# Question
What is the typical wait time for a PG&E (Pacific Gas and Electricity) repair?

_Context_:
PG&E must report to a utilities
commission about its service record.
